I am a PhD candidate in HPC group at VU University Amsterdam under the supervision of [Prof. Henri Bal](https://www.cs.vu.nl/~bal/). I am working efficient deep learning for computer vision.

Previosly, I did my Masters in parallel and distributed computer systems from VU Univeristy, Amsterdam with *Cum Laude*. I have around four years of industrial experience in computer systems, particularly distributed and data storage systems.
